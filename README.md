CRUD JS Examples with VanillaJS, AngularJS, PeasyJS, etc...


CRUD = acronym for Create Read Update Delete

In this project, I explored different ways to develop a CRUD module.
In the vanillaJS directory, you'll find different versions of the same module :
- v1 : the simpler version
- v2 : closed to v1 plus the support of constraints
- v3 : closed to v2 plus the support of localization
- v4 : closed to v3 but the Store class and the internal constraints are replaced by PeasyJS. The version 4 is not completely ended, but this first result is encouraging.
